## 📌 Overview

**Freight Route Analytics** is an intelligent railway freight route optimization system developed during my internship at **CRIS (Centre for Railway Information Systems)**.

The application analyzes **4.4 lakh+ real Indian Railways freight movement records** and recommends the most efficient freight route between any two stations using **Machine Learning** and **Graph Algorithms**.

The system predicts freight movement speed using multiple ML models and applies **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to generate optimal routes based on:

- 🚆 Shortest Distance
- ⏱ Fastest Travel Time
- ⚖ Balanced Route (Distance + Time)

---

# ✨ Features

- 🚉 Search freight routes between any two railway stations
- 🗺 Interactive route visualization using Folium Maps
- 🤖 Machine Learning-based speed prediction
- ⚡ XGBoost, LightGBM & CatBoost support
- 📊 Interactive analytics dashboard
- 📈 Model performance comparison
- 📍 Station search using station code
- 🔄 Route comparison
- 🚆 Hop-by-hop route breakdown
- 📉 Outlier analysis
- 🎯 User-friendly Streamlit interface

---

# 🧠 Machine Learning Models

The application predicts **Circuit Speed (km/h)** using three regression models.

| Model | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| 🥇 XGBoost | Highest prediction accuracy |
| 🥈 LightGBM | Fast training and inference |
| 🥉 CatBoost | Better handling of categorical features |

---

# 📊 Model Performance

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² Score |
|------|------:|------:|------:|
| 🥇 XGBoost | **1.386** | **1.958** | **0.826** |
| 🥈 LightGBM | 1.421 | 1.994 | 0.820 |
| 🥉 CatBoost | 1.446 | 2.020 | 0.815 |

**Target Variable:** `circuit_speed`

# 🛤 Route Optimization

The system generates three optimized routes using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.

| Route | Optimization |
|---------|--------------|
| 🚆 Shortest Route | Minimum Distance |
| ⏱ Fastest Route | Minimum Travel Time |
| ⚖ Balanced Route | Distance + Time |

---

# 📈 Dataset Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Freight Records | 4,41,000+ |
| Railway Stations | 3,555 |
| Directed Routes | 35,636 |
| Commodity Types | 42 |
| Wagon Types | 55 |
